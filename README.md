# Thief Busted
2-players Vanilla JS Game, where `Police` is trying to get the most weapons to bust the `Thief`, and vise-versa. Play it with a friend, or - if you're bored - play alone and bet on yourself! ðŸ˜…

## The Game
It's very simple, all you have to do is collecting weapons and then get closer to the other player to start the `Combat Mode` and the winner will be announced.
